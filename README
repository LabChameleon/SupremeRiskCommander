A little game that is supposed to be a combination of the games Risk and Supreme Commander. The game
is not finished yet and only supports one player against a static AI. The player starts with a small
amount of tanks. The terrain of the game is divided into many small rectangles of which the player
only has vision when a tank is standing inside the rectangle. When a tank stands in a rectangle for
30 seconds a new tank is spawned in the same rectangle. Thus the player has to balance how many
tanks he is using for generating new armies and how many tanks he is moving around (thus not being
able to create new tanks) for searching and defeating the enemy player.
